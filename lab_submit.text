Applications of DFS: 
Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as deeply as possible along each branch before backtracking. It has a wide range of applications in various fields, including: Â  

Computer Science:

1.Topological sorting: DFS can be used to determine the order in which tasks or activities must be completed in a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
2.Strongly connected components: DFS can be used to identify strongly connected components within a directed graph.
3.Cycle detection: DFS can be used to detect cycles in a graph.
4.Maze solving: DFS can be used to find a path through a maze or labyrinth.
5.Game theory: DFS can be used to explore game trees and find optimal strategies.
6.Artificial Intelligence:Search algorithms: DFS can be used as a search algorithm to find solutions to problems, such as solving puzzles or planning routes.
7.Machine learning: DFS can be used to explore decision trees and build classification models.
8.Network Analysis:Network traversal: DFS can be used to explore networks and identify connected components.
9.Shortest path algorithms: DFS can be used as a building block for shortest path algorithms, such as Dijkstra's algorithm.
10.Other Applications:

-Web crawling: DFS can be used to crawl websites and index web pages.
-Data analysis: DFS can be used to analyze data structures and identify patterns.
-Robotics: DFS can be used to plan paths for robots and navigate complex environments
